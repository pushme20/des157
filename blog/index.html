                The chapter that my partner and I are doing is called “The Big Bang Theory of Web Design.” In specific, this chapter discusses the homepage and its purpose on a website. When designing this page, it is important to note that users ask themselves several
                questions, including: “What is this?” and “What do they have here?” It is then the web designer’s responsibility to be empathetic to the user’s wants and their ability to digest information. These types of feelings and questions are explored
                deeper when “The Big Bang Theory of Web Design” is described.
            </p>

            <p>
                This idea is described as the initial impression/judgements that a user makes upon visiting a new website. Therefore, it is imperative that the information that a user first sees is captivating and intriguing enough for them to explore the rest of the
                site. This may take shape in the form of animations, media, or creative taglines. Taglines are phrases that encapsulate website and what make it worthwhile. These are typically labeled as “mission statements” and can often become generic
                pieces of information.
            </p>

            <p>
                To avoid a generic representation of a website or product, it is important to focus on the clarity of one’s homepage and labeling elements clearly so that the user knows where to begin. The easier it is to navigate through a homepage, the better the user’s
                experience with the site will be. This is author Steve Krug’s “fifth question” that users asks themselves: “Where do I start?”

            </p>

            <p>
                By avoiding the urge to promote individual agendas to garner more revenue, it is more important to present the user with a clear and consistent layout of information. This “Big Bang Theory” can attract or deter users from your site; the rest will follow.

                My approach to this studio was to code the html and css before I converted it to the library I was using, AngularJS. I realized near the end of the due date that this was not the best strategy because I spent more time understanding how to split each
                section into the MVC (Model-View-Controller) format. This process takes some getting used to, so I encourage people to read documentation or follow tutorials online.</p>
            <br />

            <p>
                My motivation for utilizing this JS framework was its capability in form validation and two-way data binding (changes a user makes automatically updates the html). Although it is not complete, I plan to finish this studio because I know it will make the
                process of my Final Project much smoother. Here is the <a href="https://angularjs.org/">link</a> to the AngularJS site:

                I connected various features of my design using timed events and audio. The timed eventes were triggered by "mouseover" and "mouseout" events that were read by Event Listeners. These events then called functions to make my hidden elements visible, ultimately
                playing a sound once all outer buttons became hovered on correctly. </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                The interesting interface design comes from my minimalistic approach of colors and transition effects. I tried to convey a soft, yet curious approach to idea of time using blue and subtle transitions. My goal here was to provide subtely and spark curiousity
                when clicking the buttons. </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                My last aspect of effective and interesting interface design comes from the change in background colors to indicate the times that I wanted to map to different visuals. My plan was to sync my functions with a comedian's bit about time, yet have the setTimeouts
                tigger on different functions. These functions would be used to make these drawn elements visible or perform other actions.</p>

            <p>
                Being that my final design was based around my workout gear, I decided to utilize the colors of the Olympics. I stylized the borders of each of my images with these colors. This was one of the aspects of my visual design. </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                Another aspect consists of the page layout, in which I again reference the Olympics and its layout of multiple rings. I believe that the use of color and the page layout conveys consistency through out my entire design. </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Lastly, the placement of my messages appear on the left side of the images when an image is clicked. I believe that this is part of good design because the viewer typically reads from left to right. I wanted to show the message in a way that is natural
                to the average reader. In addition, I wanted to add another layer to my design by referencing an emoji stylesheet. These emojis corresponded to the main idea in each of my messages. While I think the execution could have been handled more
                creatively, I think my concept is consistent throughout my design.</p>

            <p>I typically use the "Degree Worksheet" form on the UC Davis Oasis website". Based on Derouchey's findings, the form communicates effectively what it is asking for from its users based on the fields beneath "Topical Breadth." In addition, the
                use of colors for the typography against the faded blue-green gradient allows for great legibility. This is especially important when dealing with highly impactful data, such as major courses. For more insight on Derouchey's assessment,
                his article is located <a class="white" href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">here.</a> </p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe that this form fulfills its function in guiding students to filling out their own course checklist successfully. This ensures that they are on track to graduate by whichever quarter they are interested in graduating. It also includes
                a bit more information that highlights one's cumulative and quarterly GPA to keep them on track or seek an advisor. In sum, this form is simplistic, showcases different input/radiobuttons, and does not provide flashy background-colors.</p>

            <p>The Amazon website is a website with an extensive category and the ability to recommend items to you based upon what you purchase. In terms of distribution of information, profile, and other enhancements, it is a powerful e-commerce resource.
                With visual design it is pleasing to view and its navigation tools are easily accessible and navigable. There is also a wide search bar that allows users to begin shopping right away. Both of these elements appear at the top of the webpage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Its visual appeal is great because no elements are crammed and users are able to access exactly what they are looking for. There are different sidebars throughout the site, and its use of filters make searching for items much easier. However,
                one area where it falls short is its responsiveness on the desktop. When I manually resized my window, the elements did not respond and were cropped. I found this disappointing because it is very common and somewhat expected for a large
                corporation such as Amazon to perform at its highest level. The lack of a responsive website means that its competitors can provide a better experience for its users.</p>
