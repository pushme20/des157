            <h3 class="sm-mar-bottom">Response</h3>
            <p>The Amazon website is a website with an extensive category and the ability to recommend items to you based upon what you purchase. In terms of distribution of information, profile, and other enhancements, it is a powerful e-commerce resource. With visual design it is pleasing to view and its navigation tools are easily accessible and navigable. There is also a wide search bar that allows users to begin shopping right away. Both of these elements appear at the top of the webpage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It visual appeal is great because no elements are crammed and users are able to access exactly what they are look for. There are different sidebars throughout the site, and its use of filters make search for items much easier. However, one area where it falls short is it responsiveness on the desktop. When I manually resized my window, the elements did not respond and were cropped. I found this disappointing because it is very common and somewhat expected for a large corporation such as Amazon to perform at its highest level. The lack of a responsive website means that competitors can provide a better experience for its users.</p>
